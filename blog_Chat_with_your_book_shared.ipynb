    "# Chat with your book - Shared Version\n",
    "\n",
    "author: Remy Welch, remyw@\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will allow you use a Retrieval Augmented Generation framework to ask questions about the story and characters of a book - in this example, that book is The Council of Light by Remy Welch (find out more at remywelch.com/sci-fi-books). Request access to the PDF in [google drive:](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KZQYsAC8eeyZRTmp8RwV7VnY8PTi8sMl/view?usp=drive_link) (please add a note so I know you're not a bot).\n",
    "\n",
    "Enterprise Use Cases:\n",
    " - Customer is a Publisher that wants to allow readers to ask questions about the novels in their portfolio in order to determine whether they want to buy them or not\n",
    " - Customer is an author that wants to draw attention to their novels by making them queryable\n",
    " - Customer is an Agent who wants to learn more about the work of the authors they currently represent or are considering representing\n",
    " - Customer wants to provide a service to authors who want to determine if other novels are similar to theirs (finding \"comps\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Initialize textbison LLM with langchain\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Initialize the vector store in Vertex Search aka Matching Engine\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Load the PDF of the book, Generate embeddings from it, and load those to the vector store\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Use the RetrievalQA chain to answer questions about the book by executing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    " - 5) Do a semantic search for [QUESTION] in the vector store and return top n results as context\n",
    "\n",
    " - 6) Pass that context back to the LLM, giving it a prompt like “please answer [QUESTION] using [CONTEXT]”\n",
